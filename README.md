# 🚀 The project (Formula.Newsfeed)
This project is used for users on the app [Formula - Universal Code Editor](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/formula-universal-code-editor/9nblggh4wb6b) (version > 4) to view its the blog posts from one category of the blog (WordPress).


## 👨🏻‍💻 How to run it
For the Azure Function (Formula.Newsfeed), I recommend develop it with vscode or Visual Studio.

You may need to adjust the `FeedUri` at `local.settings.json` to your rss feed.


## 🔮 Roadmap

I'm sharing with you some of my plans to move forward with this project, right now the priorities comes like this:

* Independency: Would love to make more stuff parameterizable so it can be used in other projects outside [vtnorton](https://vtnorton.com)

* Docker: The project needs docker, and that says it all!

* YAML: would love to create the build process with yml.

Constributors of all kinds from the community are welcome, but especially those that support the efforts above.
